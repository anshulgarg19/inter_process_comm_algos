# inter_process_comm_algos
Implementation of different algorithms for bidirectional interprocess communication where both the processes can send and receive data.  
1. Using Pipes          (pipe.c)  
2. Using FIFO           (fifop1.c, fifop2.c)  
3. Using Message Queues (msgqp1.c, msgqp2.c)  
4. Using Shared Memory  (shmp1.c,  shmp2.c) (this is unidirectional comm.)
